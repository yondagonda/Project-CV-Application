## Description
A fully responsive React single-page application designed for building a CV. It allows users to easily add, edit, and delete input fields to enter their information. The preview CV is updated in real-time to reflect these changes. Once satisfied with the CV, users can save and download it to their local machine with a simple button click. Additionally, the application offers an autofill feature to populate all fields and provides a preview of what the CV looks like when filled out.

## Motivations
After having started my React learning journey, I wanted an opportunity to put into practice the concepts I had learnt such as State Management, component based designs, conditional rendering, etc.

## Showcase
Here is a GIF preview, where a user fills in their details to see the CV being edited, and then utilises the autofill feature.
